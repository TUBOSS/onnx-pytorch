ONNX export failed: Couldn't export operator expand; this usually means you used a form of broadcasting that ONNX does not currently support

Graph we tried to export:
graph(%1 : Double(3)
      %2 : Double(2, 3)) {
  %3 : Double(2!, 3) = Expand[shape=[2, 3]](%1), uses = [%4.i0];
  %4 : Double(2, 3) = Add(%3, %2), uses = [%0.i0];
  return (%4);
}
