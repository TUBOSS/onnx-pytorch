When I exported your model with different inputs, the result was different.
(To get more information, run torch.onnx.verify(..., verbose=True))
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: Strings are not equal:

  graph torch-jit-export (%name: "1"
  type {
    tensor_type {
      elem_type: DOUBLE
      shape {
        dim {
          dim_value: 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ) {
-   %2 = Mul(%1, %1)
?        ^^^
+   %2 = Add(%1, %1)
?        ^^^
    return %name: "2"
  type {
    tensor_type {
      elem_type: DOUBLE
      shape {
        dim {
          dim_value: 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  }

  * A difference in model structure usually means that
    your model has dynamic control flow.  These models are not
    currently supported by the exporter.
