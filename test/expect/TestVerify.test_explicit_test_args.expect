When I exported your model with different inputs, the result was different.
(To get more information, run torch.onnx.verify(..., verbose=True))
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: Strings are not equal:

  graph torch-jit-export (
    %0[FLOAT, 1x2]
  ) {
-   %1 = Mul(%0, %0)
?        ^^^
+   %1 = Add(%0, %0)
?        ^^^
    return %1
  }

  * A difference in model structure usually means that
    your model has dynamic control flow.  These models are not
    currently supported by the exporter.
