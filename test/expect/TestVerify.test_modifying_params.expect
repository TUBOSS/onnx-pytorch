When I exported your model with different inputs, the result was different.
(To get more information, run torch.onnx.verify(..., verbose=True))

ERROR: In embedded parameter '2': Arrays are not equal

(mismatch 100.0%)
 x: array([ 3.])
 y: array([ 4.])

  * A difference in embedded parameters usually means that
    your model is updating parameters/buffers even in inference
    mode.  Look for a buggy nn.Module which isn't respecting train().
